This project was my second end-to-end ML project where I trained a ML model to classify whether the user has heart disease or not based on user inputs of various medical fields. Data was taken from a kaggle dataset. Model has an accuracy of 90.77% and uses GaussianNB binary classification model. It helped me gain experience with deployment on render, practice my frontend skills and deployment on streamlit. <br>
(Note- ```main``` branch contains the render deployment and ```stream``` branch contains the streamlit deployment.)
