This project was a part of project I built at a hackathon, not exactly what I built in the hackathon but a simpler and refined version of it. Consists of 2 parts - A loan approval prediction classification model with 97.5% accuracy, made on a dataset obtained from Kaggle - US banks based (couldn't find datasets for indian banks); second part is - Mutual Funds insights, uses Indian Mutual funds API to fetch latest available data for a mutual fund selected by user and displays nav and trend lines on a graph. I deployed this webapp on streamlit.<br>
